The game to take over the world, by avoiding guards, and doing household chores. ... 

This is a game featured on the tubeface (and featuring facetubes) (bookface... Fakebook.) 

no seriously, I made it (at least parts of it on Youtube. )

WE have some base limitations.  (Thanks to ygd.bafta.org/resources/game-idea-generator)
It must be Set in ALTERNATE reality
The Goal is to escape (like get out of a maze, or something like that )
I want the game to be very relaxed, and one touch kind of game (one touch at a time) and the computer/ai doesnt move when you don't and doesn't act when you dont. 
 the idea is to avoid enemies.  and the main of the game is to do household chores. 

the simplest ideas that come to mind is to make it 100% build on prior knowledge, like using the grid and movement of chess pieces, or the systems of pac-man. but make it infinitely interesting by procedural generation and use of neural networks in guards... (with some "speed training hacks" ) hehehhe 9evil laugh
